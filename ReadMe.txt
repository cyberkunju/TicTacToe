This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" using Java Swing, developed by @cyberkunju. The game is designed to be played by two players on the same machine.  The project is organized in a single package named src. Inside this package, there is a single class TicTacToe which contains all the logic and UI for the game.  Here are the key components used in this project:  
Java Swing: This is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) â€” an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs. Swing was used to create all the graphical components in this project like frames, buttons, labels, and text fields.  
Event Listeners: These are used to handle user interactions. For example, when a button is clicked or when text is entered in a text field, an event is triggered and the corresponding event listener handles that event.  
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): This is Java's original platform-dependent windowing, graphics, and user-interface widget toolkit. AWT is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and was used for certain tasks like opening a URL in the user's default web browser.  
Java Logging API: This is used to log warnings when there is an issue opening the URL in the user's default web browser.  
The game starts with an instruction dialog explaining the rules of the game. Players enter their names and take turns to play the game by clicking on the cells. The game keeps track of the number of wins for each player and the number of draws. Players can reset the game at any point by clicking the 'RESET' button.  This project is a great example of how to create a simple, interactive desktop application using Java Swing. It demonstrates the use of various Swing components, event handling, and basic game logic.  All rights reserved by @cyberkunju.
